<p><b>Assignment Plan </b>
<ul>
<li> 3 in-class exams: 40% of final grade
<li> 4-6 homework assignments : 50% of final grade
<li> Several "classroom" exercises and/or pop quizzes (up to once a week):
     up to 10% of final grade.  You will be allowed one free omission.
     These quizzes will include open discussion of the
     questions with your neighbors during class.  You get full credit for a
     good-faith effort to answer the questions (for those handed in during class).
     If your performance on the quizzes is consistently different from your performance on the homeworks and exams, we
     may ask for an explanation.
<li> Final grade will be based on a weighted average of your scores, assuming you have
reached the minimum threshold in each category. 
<li> Grade cut-offs: 91% for an A or A-, 82% for at least a B-, 73% for at least a C-.
</ul>

<p><b>General Information</b>
<br>
This course introduces the basic numerical techniques to solve mathematical
problems on a digital computer.  Algorithms for several common problems
encountered in computer science, mathematics, science and engineering are introduced.  The
pitfalls and errors that can arise when solving mathematical problems with
methods taking finite time and in finite precision arithmetic are discussed,
and measures to predict when such pitfalls are encountered will be introduced.

<P>
<P><b>Computer Platform</b> <p>
Students will be expected to implement several of the algorithms on a
digital computer using python with a limited set of packages
(e.g., numpy, matplotlib, pdb, plus a few functions listed explicitly from other packages).
In the cases where another equivalent interactive
programming environment is allowed, you will be responsible for
implementing the equivalent features and may find only limited help from
the instructional staff.
Students should be familiar with basic programming
techniques. <!--  as well as being able use the help system in MATLAB. -->
Students
should also be acquainted with the basic concepts of the more elementary
mathematical and numerical methods
(e.g. solving simple linear equations, root-finding,
computing averages, using derivatives to find the minimum of a scalar function,
etc.) though some of this will be reviewed during the course.

<P><b>Ethics</b> <p>
All items handed in to be graded must represent the individual effort of
whoever's name(s) appears on the item.  At a minimum, violators of this policy
may fail the course and/or may have their names recorded at 
appropriate University or Departmental offices.  Mutual discussion
of each individual's results in the homeworks is encouraged, as long as
the results themselves represent individual efforts.  If you use or submit
any material or software you obtained from the WWW, any chatbot or LLM, or any other source outside of
class or the textbooks, you must cite it including an explanation of how you used that outside source. 
In some assignments, you may be restricted on what software you can use.

If there are any questions about the source of your answers, you may be asked to explain your understanding
of the answers in person.  This may occur if there is a consistent mismatch between your performance on
in-class items versus take-home submissions.

<P><b>Assignments and Grading</b> <p>
Some assignments may be graded in an appreviated manner with credit for some questions being awarded based just
on a quick look for the presence of  proper answers.
Some assignments
may be assigned to be done by pairs of students;
such items should be handed in as a single item
listing the names of all participants.  To pass the course at any level,
you will have to achieve a passing grade at a commensurate level on the exams alone, and do
satisfactorily on the homeworks.
Any questions about the grading of any item 
must be asked within a week of when items are first
handed back to students.  After one week has passed, the scores become final.

Exams are in class with no electronic devices allowed.  You can bring and refer to anything on paper such  as 
class notes printed in advance, a crib sheet, etc.  A simple calculator with no wireless connection capability will be
allowed, though some effort will be made to keep any necessary arithmetic as simple as possible.

The above policies do not apply to in-class classroom exercises during which talk among yourselves and accessing the
network will be allowed and even encouraged.  A good-faith effort to answer the questions is sufficient for full
credit, as long as the answers are handed in at the end of the class period.  Anything handed in later  for any reason
whatsoever (even if legitimate) will get only
partial credit based on the correctness of the answers.  However you are allowed to miss up to two clasroom exercises
during the semester without any penalty.

<P><b>Electronic Submission</b> <p>
Unless otherwise stated, all work done outside of class must be submitted electronically through 
<a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/540867" target="_blank">canvas</a>.
We are not responsible if we cannot read your handwriting,
or if electronic scans of written material are unreadable.
Even if late, all submissions should be submitted as a single unit
directly to canvas  <!-- or to the instructor or TA -->
(no parts submitted separately at a later time). 
<P>
Exception: In many homeworks we will ask for your code.  You should collect all your code into a ZIP file <b>and</b>
generate a PDF file with all your explanation and output.  Submit the PDF file and ZIP file as two separate items.
If you use a jupyter notebook with your explanations mixed in with code, you can export your notebook to a PDF file and
submit that PDF file, but you must also submit the original jupyter notebook in a ZIP file or include a pointer to the notebook
in your PDF file.  A pointer to a colab notebook will suffice, but make sure the colab notebook is readable to the instructor and TA.
<P>
Electronic homework submissions  must include a PDF file containing the
answers to the questions, associated explanations and graphics.  It can also include a printout of any
code you use.  Any code beyond a few lines should be collected into a separate ZIP file submitted
separately through canvas (or include a pointer to the respective colab notebook in your PDF file).
All submissions should consist of at most 2 files:  the main PDF file and a ZIP file with everything else. Do
not include the PDF file within the ZIP file.
If there is no computer
code, then just submit the single PDF file containing all your written answers.
Do not use 'rar', 'tar', '7zip' or any other archiver.  
Submit the PDF file as a separate file, not within the ZIP file.
Make sure the PDF file is readable and that scans of handwritten material are legible.
We are not responsible if we have any problems reading it.  

<P><b>Late Homework Submissions</b> <p>
Homeworks will be accepted until answers have been posted or discussed in class
 or up to three working days
after the due date (whichever occurs first).
For regular homeworks, the late penalty will grow nonlinearly with the delay:
1% if within 12 hours (<i> only once during the semester</i>), 2% if within 24 hours, 10% up to 2 days,
20% if more.
The penalty will be doubled for items with due dates  within 1 day of  the posting date, and anything due in
the last week of class.  The score posted for any assignment might not include any late penalty, which may be
imposed and recorded later as a separate item.
<!-- Late short-turnaround assignments may not be accepted at all,
but if accepted the late penalty will be
2% if within 12 hours(*), 15% within 24 hours, 30% if more. -->
If unable to complete a quiz during class, you should hand in what you can in class, and hand in
your more complete answer by 11:59pm the same day.  Quizzes handed during class will be scored based on a good faith effort.
Quizzes handed in later  for any reason (including legitimate ones) will be scored on correctness and receive only partial credit.
We suggest you photograph your in-class quiz with your cell phone before handing it in.
Answers to homeworks and quizzes could be posted any time after the due date/time without advance notice,
after which no more submissions will be accepted.
Whether or not a per-assignment penalty is applied or waived based on a reasonable and unanticipated excuse,
the final semester accumulated score will be reduced by 1 point for each item handed in late.
