<h1>Some MATLAB hints</h1>

<ul>

<li> To start matlab, you type
<ul>
<li><tt>module load math/matlab</tt> (should do this only once)
<li><tt>matlab &amp;</tt>
</ul>
If you want to run matlab without all the fancy windows, use one of the
follwing instead
<ul>
<li><tt>matlab -nodesktop</tt>
<li><tt>matlab -nojvm</tt>
</ul>

<li> Start matlab and type <tt>help intro</tt>.

<li>
When you say <tt>x*y</tt>, this is defined as matrix-matrix multiplication:
the number of columns of <tt>x</tt> must match the number of rows of
<tt>y</tt> (unless one of them is a scalar).  If 
<tt>x</tt>
and
<tt>y</tt>
have the same shape, you can multiply each element of
<tt>x</tt> by the corresponding element of <tt>y</tt> by using
<tt>x.*y</tt> .
<li>
If 
<tt>x</tt>
is a vector, you can get its length with <tt>length(x)</tt>.
If 
<tt>x</tt> is a matrix, you can get its dimensions with
<tt>size(x)</tt> .  This means, for example, that you don't have to pass the
dimensions of the your arrays to your functions; this information can be
retrieved within the function automatically.
<li>
If you run into any matlab error, you can type <tt>dbstop if error</tt>
to enter the debugger the <i>next</i> time you run into the error.
You will get a different prompt, where you can type out the values of all
the variables involved in the line where the error occured.
Be sure to exit the debugger with <tt>dbquit</tt> before continuing.
<LI>
When writing the MATLAB code for the bisection problem, there are three ways
to enter the expression needed for the function <tt>f</tt>:
<ul>
<LI>repeat the entire expression everytime you need it (for readability,
assign the expression to a new temporary variable and use the temporary);
<LI>write the expression in a file called <tt>f.m</tt> using the function syntax
listed by the <tt>help function</tt> command;
<LI>use the "inline function" syntax explained by the <tt>help inline</tt> command.
</ul>
<LI>
To print out a row of numbers, you can use something like
<tt>disp([1,3.14159,x])</tt>.  Vary the number of digits displayed with the
<tt>format</tt> command (see <tt>help format</tt> for options).
Alternatively, you can use <tt>fprintf</tt> (type <tt>help fprintf</tt>).
